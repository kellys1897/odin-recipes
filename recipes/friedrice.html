            <h2>I honestly wouldn't mind eating this everyday..</h2>
            <p>Kimchi fried rice is the perfect dish when you have leftover rice from the previous day. It's even better if you have Kimchi that has become more sour over time. This is a popular dish among Koreans for an easy at home recipe that doesn't require much! </p>
