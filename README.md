# odin-recipes
My first Odin project!
This is my first project that I've worked on by myself to create a website dedicated to Korean home cooking recipes. I want this website to be resourceful, organized and helpful to those cooking Korean recipes at home. I used HTML and GIT skills to build this website and I will add CSS personalization later on.
For the look, I want it to be clean, minimalistic and make users feel at peace using the website.
